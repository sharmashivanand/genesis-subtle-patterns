Genesis Subtle Patterns enables you to use subtle patterns for site background with super-ease. Works exclusively with the Genesis Framework.

== Description ==

Ever wanted to use subtle patterns for your Genesis website? Genesis Subtle Patterns allows you to add subtle patterns as the site background. You can quickly select a subtle pattern from the available patterns and save it as a background for your Genesis site.

The plugin offers you a user-friendly and intuitive pattern selector with entire collection of subtle patterns and live preview your active selection. You can preview all the patterns on your site and simply save the one that works for your site. Currently. there are 200+ patterns and you get more as and when new patterns are added to the Subtle Patterns repository.

Want more customizations? Once you've selected the background pattern for your site, you can go to the customizer to tweak the background properties — background attachment, position and repeat.

After finalizing the subtle background for your Genesis site, you may want to hide the pattern selector UI from the front-end. Just go to Genesis > Subtle Patterns and disable the option.

The greatest advantage of using Genesis Subtle Patterns is that it does not bloat your site with hundreds of pattern image files. The image file is downloaded for your use only when you save an image as the background. Live preview enables you to navigate through the patterns and previewing them without actually downloading the patterns.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin allow me to preview the patterns as background on my website in real time? =

Yes, you can navigate through the hundreds of patterns and preview them live on your website. Once you've chosen a pattern that works for your site you can save it as the background.

= Hundreds of patterns wouldn't bloat my website with images! Really? =

Yes, that stands true as long as you're previewing the patterns on your site. Once you save the pattern as the background, the selected pattern will be downloaded to your WordPress uploads directory so as to set it up as the background and to allow you to control  background properties through WordPress Customizer.

= This pattern selector UI is just annoying me. Can I disable it completely? =

Once you've set a background for your website, you can disable the UI on the front-end. Just go to **Genesis** > **Subtle Patterns** and uncheck the option "Enable pattern selector".

If this option is enabled, the UI will appear on the front-end on every page reload. The *Close* button on the pattern selector will just remove the panel from that page for that session until it is reloaded.
